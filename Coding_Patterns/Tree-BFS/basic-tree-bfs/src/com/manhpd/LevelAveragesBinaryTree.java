 * Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent the averages of all of its levels.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * The original binary tree:
 * [[1],
 * [2; 3],
 * [4, 5; 6, 7]]
 *
 * Output: Level Averages: [1, 2.5, 5.5]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * The original binary tree:
 * [[12],
 * [7; 1],
 * [9, 2; 10, 5]]
 *
 * Output: Level Averages: [12.0, 4.0, 6.5]
