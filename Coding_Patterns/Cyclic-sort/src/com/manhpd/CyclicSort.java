/**
 * We are given an array containing n objects. Each object, when created, was assigned a unique number from the range 1 to n based on their creation sequence.
 * This means that the object with sequence number 3 was created just before the object with sequence number 4.
 *
 * Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their creation sequence number in O(n) and without using any extra space.
 * For simplicity, letâ€™s assume we are passed an integer array containing only the sequence numbers, though each number is actually an object.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]
 * Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [2, 6, 4, 3, 1, 5]
 * Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: [1, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2]
 * Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
