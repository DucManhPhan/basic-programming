/**
 * Given an array of positive numbers, where each element represents the max number of jumps that can be made forward from that element,
 * write a program to find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element).
 * If an element is 0, then we cannot move through that element.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input = {2,1,1,1,4}
 * Output = 3
 * Explanation: Starting from index '0', we can reach the last index through: 0->2->3->4
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input = {1,1,3,6,9,3,0,1,3}
 * Output = 4
 * Explanation: Starting from index '0', we can reach the last index through: 0->1->2->3->8
