/**
 * Given a set of positive numbers, partition the set into two subsets with a minimum difference between their subset sums.
 *
 * Example 1: #
 * Input: {1, 2, 3, 9}
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can partition the given set into two subsets where the minimum absolute difference
 * between the sum of numbers is '3'. Following are the two subsets: {1, 2, 3} & {9}.
 *
 * Example 2: #
 * Input: {1, 2, 7, 1, 5}
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: We can partition the given set into two subsets where the minimum absolute difference
 * between the sum of numbers is '0'. Following are the two subsets: {1, 2, 5} & {7, 1}.
 *
 * Example 3: #
 * Input: {1, 3, 100, 4}
 * Output: 92
 * Explanation: We can partition the given set into two subsets where the minimum absolute difference
 * between the sum of numbers is '92'. Here are the two subsets: {1, 3, 4} & {100}.
